# RelORM

Write a three page report following the structure and content laid out below:

(use Use New Times Roman serif  font and 12 pt size, double spaced. Use heading to distinguish topics you introduce,-- no James Joyce stream of consciousness wanted) :-) A report consists of:

Cover sheet : Assignment name, student name, Course Name/section date

body of report: topics separated by headings ( i won't read papers consisting of simply one long paragraph)

**********************************************************************

--- The overall intent is to compare and contrast the relational  design approach versus the (Halpin)  ORM approach, using both graphics & text

1. Note: this assignment is due on a wednesday ( after the second zoom meetup)  because of a short week, usually the assignments are due sunday night of that same week.

2. For this assignment and for the future, you will need to download the (free) CmapTools app.

https://cmap.ihmc.us/cmaptools/cmaptools-download/

I will show how it can be used in the zoom meetups. the app also has a comprehensive help sections

First: Do your Background study: 

1. Read carefully: Valera's  foreword, Halpin's  preface & Ch 1 ( note especially why he thinks projects fail, do you agree?)

2. Read Murach Ch1, Overview,  Ch 10 database  design. ( does Murach have a systematic procedure for design)?

 

*************** Assignment Structure & Content *******************

Part A. The concept map(CmapTools) will show what areas you are fluent in and, what areas are worth digging deeper.

Part B. A discussion by you, elaborating on the main concepts laid out by the concept map. and the requested discussion areas below:

Overarching topic 
Information base versus? database?

ORM Concepts:
ORM diagram features
Domain Entity, Entity type            ( note carefully the difference between entity and entity type. An Invoice table is the type (Invoice), the rows are entities, the instances of the type)
Domain value , Domain value type
Constraints: uniqueness, mandatory

Relational concepts
Relation ( what is its connection to a table
tuple.   ( what is its connection to a sql row
primary key ( relation to uniqueness & mandatory constraint
Foreign  key ( relation to uniqueness & mandatory constraint
candidate key ( relation to uniqueness

 

Thoughts to ponder: 

Cmap of ORM & Relational approaches ( are they at same level ??
( conceptual vs Logical) What are the probable consequences of starting with relational design   versus starting with ORM?
